# Bitcoin Swift

Swift Bitcoin is a bitcoin library for Swift. It is written entirely using The Swift Programming Language with the exception of the Elliptic Curve Cryptography part which is outsourced to [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1).

The library can be used in open-source development targeting UNIX/Linux or Apple Platforms (e.g. iOS).

While still under development, the goal is to provide full node capabilities to any app using Swift Bitcoin.
