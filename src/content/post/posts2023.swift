Last year the development of _Swift Bitcoin_ really kicked off. All research work done on the `swift-bitcoin-poc` repo was carefully moved over and improved. This includes the transaction model and script engine with full segwit and taproot support.

Other important milestones were reached. All consensus [BIPs](https://github.com/swift-bitcoin/swift-bitcoin/issues?q=label%3ABIP+is%3Aclosed) involving transactions are now implemented and tested using vectors from the specs.

Data-driven [tests](https://github.com/swift-bitcoin/swift-bitcoin/issues?q=label%3ATesting+is%3Aclosed+) from Bitcoin Core covering valid/invalid transactions were ported in their totality. After considerable bug fixing and filling in blanks these tests ended up passing. The same goes for a substantial portion of taproot transaction tests.

Porting Core's tests over meant enacting all different verification flags used for configuring the script interpreter to the point of full parity.

More recently [wallet functionality](https://github.com/swift-bitcoin/swift-bitcoin/milestone/9) was added with support for encoding/decoding all types of addresses. Relevant BIPs were implemented, namely BIP32 and BIP39.

The project grew from a simple library to a package containing several integration points. Cryptography and helper functions now live in their own module while executable targets were added for utility functions and peer-to-peer "full" node functionality.

All functions calling `libsecp256k1` were rewritten in pure Swift leveraging C-language interoperability.

A big effort was made to instate RPC and P2P client/server capabilities. Thanks to [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) it was possible to do this in an optimized and robust way, setting the basis for a full-blown transport layer.

This year's milestones are centered around implementing all block and transport-related BIPs. Internally a mempool, a blockchain and a chainstate will need to be created first in memory then efficiently on-disk.

Externally the goal is to get Swift Bitcoin talking to other network clients sharing blocks and transactions. Here hoping to get there before October 31st!

The ultimate goal for Swift Bitcoin is to become the most comprehensive SDK for bitcoin in Swift with features like mempool management, block mining and connectivity via the bitcoin protocol.

The library is being written entirely in Swift. Its only dependency is the official [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for ECDSA and [Schnorr](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki) cryptography.

The library aims to provide full support for bitcoin [transactions](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction), [SCRIPT](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script), [segregated witness](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki), [taproot](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki), [tapscript](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki) and more.

# Development Roadmap

We want the library to be fully tested from the beginning. When available we will use test vectors from the BIPs and reference implementations or port tests directly from [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org).

This implies a slow and steady progress but the end result will be a secure and robust product on which developers can base their solutions.

Below is a rough roadmap of the order in which features could be integrated.

- Full transaction model with script, lock-time, input sequence and witness.
- Transaction serialization and deserialization.
- SCRIPT interpreter loop.
- Transaction signature hash, signature [signature hash types](https://river.com/learn/terms/s/sighash-flag/) and signature generation (ECDSA).
- [`OP_CHECKSIG`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_CHECKSIG).
- Transaction verifying for Pay-to-Public-Key (`P2PK`) and Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (`P2PKH`).
- [`OP_RIPEMD160`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/RIPEMD-160), `OP_SHA256`, `OP_HASH256`, `OP_HASH160` and other cryptographic operations.
- `Base58` and [`Base58Check`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding) address encoding/decoding.
- [`OP_CHECKMULTISIG`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_CHECKMULTISIG).
- Transaction verifying [`P2SH`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki).
- [Relative lock-time](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki).
- [`OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki).
- [`OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki).
- [`NULLDUMMY`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0147).
- Other script operations (arithmetic, stack, â€¦).
- [Segwit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki) transaction verifying `P2WPKH`, `P2WSH`, `P2SH-P2WPKH`, `P2SH-P2WSH`.
- [`Bech32`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) address encoding/decoding.
- Transaction Schnorr signature generation.
- Pay-to-Taproot [`P2TR`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0086.mediawiki) (key-hash spends only).
- Transaction signing for all standard scripts.
- [`Bech32m`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0350.mediawiki) address encoding/decoding.
- `OP_CHECKSIGADD` (witness V1 script).
- Tapscript transactions.

[Swift Bitcoin](https://github.com/swift-bitcoin/swift-bitcoin) aka _The Swift Bitcoin Library_ is a new project intended for Swift developers who want to build a bitcoin product.

# Apple Platforms

Being the language of the App Store it should come as a surprise that xOS bitcoin apps need to rely on non-Swift libraries for their implementation.

# Server Side

With first-class support for actors and structured concurrency, open-source Swift is more than suitable for building services like full nodes or desktop wallets. Whether running on Linux or on the Mac, a pure Swift package with virtually no additional dependencies is the ideal foundation for green-field software development.

# Bitcoin Core Cryptography

Good bitcoin devs know not to roll their own crypto. That is why Swift Bitcoin leverages the power of Core's `secp256k` library. Thanks to Swift's best-in-class C and C++ interoperability, this integrations is as tight as it can be, leaving no room for devastating errors.

# Development

While the efforts to build out the library are ongoing, a great deal of research has already taken place over the past 12 months. The focus will now switch to ensuring a clear, idiomatic API along with accurate and complete DocC documentation as well as full unit test quality coverage. I will personally do my best to develop the library in the open while accepting help from knowledgable plebs.
